# base-template-vue
 Basic project template for vue.js

Some directories contain a file named 'dummy.txt'.
This file created in order to tell git to commit these
directories, because git default behavior is to ignore empty directories.
If you created at least one relevant file inside one of those directories,
you can delete the 'dummy.txt' file from it.
